# Image Comparison
This project began alongside the <a href="http://apps.carleton.edu/esternay/">esternay project</a>. We have 2 large sets of scanned images, one of originals, in TIF format, and another of smaller, web friendly JPG images. The JPGs are named correctly, but the correctly named set of TIF images was lost. We need to find a match for each TIF in the JPGs so that they can be named correctly for the database.

All of the images are of old handwritten documents in French, on yellowing paper, so an algorithm to compare and match them was found to be inaccurate. This application was created to allow a human to see the best matching JPG images for any given TIF and select the actual match from that set.

Work is complete on the basic application. If you'd like to run it on an image set, get in touch with me and I will get you the zip you need.
